# Contributing to the Programming Language Repository Analyzer

We're рады ( рады is Bulgarian for "happy" ) to welcome you as a contributor to this project! This document outlines the contribution process and our community standards.

## Getting Started

If you're new to GitHub contributions, we recommend checking out these resources:

* **Forking a Repository:** https://docs.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo
* **Creating a Pull Request:** https://docs.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests
* **Contributing to Open Source:** https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github

## Project Overview

This project analyzes popular GitHub repositories to count the number of repositories by programming language. It leverages the GitHub REST API to retrieve data on repositories with at least one star. Subsequently, it processes the results and generates a visual representation (bar chart) depicting the distribution of programming languages. Finally, the findings are documented in a markdown file alongside the generated bar chart.
