# Security Policy

This document outlines the security practices and considerations for the Programming Language Repository Analyzer project.

**1. Scope**

This policy applies to all aspects of the project, including:

* **Source Code:** All code written for this project, including libraries, scripts, and configuration files.
* **Data Handling:** The collection, storage, and processing of data related to GitHub repositories.
* **Third-Party Dependencies:** The use of external libraries and services.
* **Deployment:** The deployment and maintenance of the project in any environment.

**2. Security Goals**

* **Confidentiality:** Protect sensitive data, such as API keys and user information, from unauthorized access.
* **Integrity:** Ensure the accuracy and completeness of project data and code.
* **Availability:** Maintain the availability and accessibility of the project and its services.

**3. Security Practices**

* **Secure Coding Practices:** 
    * Follow secure coding guidelines (e.g., OWASP, CWE) to prevent common vulnerabilities.
    * Regularly review and update code for security vulnerabilities.
    * Perform code reviews to identify and address potential security issues.
* **Data Security:**
    * Minimize data collection to only what is necessary for the project's functionality.
    * Store sensitive data securely (e.g., encrypted at rest and in transit).
    * Implement appropriate access controls to limit data access to authorized personnel.
    * Regularly review and update data security measures.
* **Third-Party Dependency Management:**
    * Use a dependency management tool (e.g., pip, npm) to manage and update project dependencies.
    * Regularly check for and address security vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    * Prioritize using well-maintained and actively supported libraries.
* **Deployment Security:**
    * Securely configure the project's deployment environment.
    * Implement appropriate access controls to limit access to the deployed system.
    * Regularly monitor the deployed system for security threats.
* **Incident Response:**
    * Establish an incident response plan to handle security breaches effectively.
    * Regularly test and update the incident response plan.

**4. Roles and Responsibilities**

* **Developers:** Responsible for adhering to secure coding practices and implementing security measures in their code.
* **Maintainers:** Responsible for overseeing the overall security of the project and ensuring compliance with this policy.

**5. Policy Enforcement**

* Regular security audits and code reviews will be conducted to assess compliance with this policy.
* Violations of this policy will be addressed appropriately.

**6. Policy Updates**

This policy will be reviewed and updated periodically to reflect changes in technology, threats, and best practices.
